## Week 4 â€“ Memory Management and Resource Allocation

In Week 4, we focused on theoretical concepts rather than hands-on terminal tasks.  
The main topics covered included:

- **Memory Management:** Understanding how the operating system allocates and manages memory for processes.
- **Paging vs. Segmentation:** We learned the difference between these two memory management techniques and how they help in efficient memory usage.
- **Virtual Memory:** We explored how systems use virtual memory to extend physical memory using disk space.
- **Swapping:** The mechanism of temporarily moving processes in and out of memory to manage limited RAM.
- **Resource Allocation:** We discussed how the OS assigns CPU, memory, and I/O resources to processes, and how deadlock and starvation can occur if resources are mismanaged.

This week provided a deeper understanding of how the OS manages system resources and memory behind the scenes, laying the groundwork for future system optimization tasks.
