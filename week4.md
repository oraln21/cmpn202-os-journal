Week 4 – User and Process Management

In this week, I focused on Linux user and process management. I examined running processes using commands such as `top` and `ps aux`, which helped me understand how the operating system manages active tasks and system resources.

I created a new directory called `week4_test` to organise my work. Using administrative privileges, I added a new user account named `testuser` with the `sudo adduser` command. This demonstrated how Linux handles multi-user environments and access control.

After creating the user, I verified its existence by checking the `/etc/passwd` file and successfully switched to the new user account using the `su - testuser` command. This confirmed that the user was correctly created and able to log in.

This week improved my understanding of Linux user accounts, permissions, and the relationship between users and running processes within the system.
