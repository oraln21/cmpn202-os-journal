Week 2 – Linux Basics and File System
Week 2 – System Exploration and File System Navigation

In Week 2, I explored the Linux file system and practiced essential command-line operations using the Ubuntu 25.10 virtual machine running on UTM (ARM64).

I began by identifying my current working directory using the `pwd` command, which confirmed that I was operating within my home directory. I then used `ls`, `ls -l`, and `ls -la` to list directory contents, view file permissions, ownership, and reveal hidden files. These commands helped me understand how Linux organizes files and manages access rights.

To practice directory management, I created a new directory called `week2_test` using the `mkdir` command and navigated into it with `cd`. I verified the directory change again using `pwd`. Inside this directory, I created an empty file named `testfile.txt` with the `touch` command and confirmed its existence using `ls`. I also used `cat` to display the file contents, confirming that the file was empty.

Additionally, I examined system storage and memory usage. The `df -h` command was used to display disk space usage in a human-readable format, while `free -h` provided information about system memory and swap usage. These commands are essential for monitoring system resources and understanding how Linux manages hardware.

This week improved my confidence in navigating the Linux file system, managing files and directories, and interpreting system resource information through the command line.
