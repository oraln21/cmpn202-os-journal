Week 6 – Process Monitoring and Management

In Week 6, I focused on understanding how Linux manages running processes and how system resources are monitored in real time. I used standard Linux process monitoring tools to observe CPU usage, memory consumption, and active system services.

I used the top command to monitor running processes dynamically. This command provided real-time information about system load, task states, CPU usage, memory usage, and individual processes. From this output, I was able to identify which processes were consuming the most system resources and observe how Linux schedules tasks.

To view a snapshot of all running processes, I used the ps aux command. This command lists processes along with their user, PID (Process ID), CPU usage, memory usage, and execution state. I also filtered specific processes using grep, for example by searching for GNOME-related services, which helped me understand how desktop environments run multiple background processes.

Through this exercise, I learned that each running program in Linux is represented as a process with a unique PID, and system monitoring tools are essential for performance analysis and troubleshooting. These tools are particularly important for system administrators when diagnosing high resource usage or managing running services.
