Week 1 – System Planning & Distribution Selection

Selected Operating System: Ubuntu 25.10 (ARM64)

Ubuntu 25.10 was selected for this coursework as it provides a modern Linux environment with up-to-date kernel support, making it suitable for studying operating system concepts such as process management, memory management, and inter-process communication.

The system is installed on an ARM64 architecture using UTM with QEMU virtualization on macOS. This setup closely reflects real-world Linux server environments while remaining lightweight and stable for academic experimentation.

Ubuntu was chosen due to:

Strong community and documentation support

Native compatibility with ARM-based systems

Modern Linux kernel (6.17)

Long-term relevance for software engineering and system administration

The installation was verified using standard Linux commands (lsb_release and uname) and system settings, with screenshots provided as evidence.
