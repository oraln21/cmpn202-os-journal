# Week 1 Journal – Installing Ubuntu on UTM (macOS ARM)

##  What I Did

This week, I set up a virtual machine on my MacBook Pro using **UTM** and installed **Ubuntu 25.10 (ARM64)**. 

Tasks I completed:
- Downloaded UTM for macOS.
- Created a virtual machine with the following specs:
  - Architecture: ARM64
  - RAM: 4 GB
  - Disk: 10.15 GB
- Mounted the Ubuntu ISO file (`ubuntu-25.10-desktop-arm64.iso`) as a virtual CD/DVD.
- Installed Ubuntu 25.10 successfully inside the virtual machine.
- Logged in and accessed the Linux terminal.

## Terminal Commands Executed

```bash
ls         # List files and directories
cd         # Change directory
pwd        # Show current directory path

Screenshots Included

UTM home screen with the created VM.

ISO image mounted in UTM settings.

Ubuntu installation interface.

Ubuntu desktop screen after login.

Terminal running basic commands like ls.

What I Learned

What virtual machines are and why they are useful in operating systems.

How to allocate system resources (CPU, RAM, storage) to a virtual machine.

Basic Linux terminal usage: navigating with ls, cd, and pwd.

The structure and appearance of a Linux desktop environment.

Reflection

This was my first time creating and configuring a virtual machine on macOS using UTM. I now feel more confident working with Linux and using the terminal. I’m looking forward to more advanced system configuration in the next weeks.
