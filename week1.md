During Week 1, I successfully installed Ubuntu 25.10 ARM 64-bit on my MacBook Pro using UTM.
I planned the system architecture, selected Ubuntu for its ARM support and stability, and confirmed the system specifications using Linux commands.
This week helped me understand how virtualization works, how to verify network and system configurations, and how to document the setup properly.
