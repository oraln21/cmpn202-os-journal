Week 7 – System Monitoring and Logs

In Week 7, I focused on system monitoring and performance analysis in Linux. 
I used several built-in tools to observe system uptime, active users, services, 
resource usage, and system logs.

The `uptime` command was used to determine how long the system had been running 
and to analyse load averages. User activity was checked using `who` and `users`.

I examined system services using `systemctl`, which provided insight into how 
Linux manages background services. System logs were analysed using `journalctl`, 
allowing me to review recent events and boot-related messages.

Performance monitoring tools such as `vmstat`, `iostat`, and `top` were used to 
observe CPU, memory, and disk usage in real time. These tools helped me understand 
how Linux allocates resources and how running processes affect system performance.

This week improved my understanding of Linux system diagnostics and prepared me 
to analyse performance issues in real-world environments.
